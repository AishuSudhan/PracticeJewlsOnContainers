# PracticeJewlsOnContainers
i changed the WebMVC name to Infrastructure because when i create new project solution for web i accidently created with the name Infrastructure.
"your web project is the name that is used to create the dll and the folder.
when you refer that in the docker it refers to the folder name". eventhough i rename it to WebMVC the dll folder in git didn't change and causing problem while creating Docker container.
so i had to change it.
so,if you want to rename the project name you can create new project instead of rename the name. you can rename the folder name but not the project solution name.
